# Naetion-NTN
The primary purpose of $NTN will be to reward ecosystem investment. It will do it using the channels listed below:

For Haelpers who reach particular milestones, rewards are provided via the HAELP app. The more a Haelper invests, the higher the rewards become. To put it another way, the more money you put in, the better the returns on each marginal action will be.
For example:
• Get 4.2 $NTN when you get your first 5-star review.
• Get 30.6 when you get your 5th
• Get 101.3 when you get your 10th, etc.

Bounties and incentives are given out in exchange for developing ideas that benefit the HAELP ecosystem. This is a lot more customizable than in-app awards, and it'll be a wonderful way to encourage everyone to contribute to the community's growth.
Referral and validation work carried out by the community. 

There will be rewards for: Referring new clients and Haelpers. Validating new Haelpers: Checking references, interviewing, and onboarding new Haelpers into the app. ️
When a client and a Haelper disagree, a dispute resolution process comes into play. We will establish a jury system in which community members can earn $NTN by assisting in the resolution of conflicts. Find out more about how this system works at: docs.naetion.xyz
Governance. Holders of Naetion Coin will be able to propose and vote on changes to the product and ecosystem.

'User ownership' is crucial to our beliefs and a key differentiator between Naetion and web2 competitors.
Powerups. In the app, Haelpers and clients both will be able to use $NTN to purchase powerups that give them one-time or sustained advantages.For example: A powerup that allows a client to get 10% off on their next 2 projects A powerup that allows a Haelper to unlock a higher position in the Haelp search results for the next 7 days.
Benefits market. Haelpers will also be able to use their $NTN in the in-app shop to purchase benefits packages, work equipment, and other items. They can invest their $NTN in a better health plan or get a discount on a new pair of noise-cancelling headphones. It is entirely their decision.
Staking, saving, lending, and borrowing are all options. 

Holders of Naetion Coin and Haelp users will be able to earn yield and borrow funds through a range of decentralized financial services. Stakeholders and lenders will be paid yield from transaction fees and loan interest.
The Naetion Discord Community has been Tokenized, which means that members will receive $NTN as a reward for participating in the community and completing certain tasks.
